# üåä Smart Flood Warning System

A project to design and build a smart flood warning system model using ESP32 microcontrollers and LoRa wireless communication.

---

## üéØ **Objective**

To build a system capable of real-time water level measurement and delivering timely warnings to residents through various methods (LEDs, speakers, Telegram messages) to minimize flood-related damages.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

The system comprises two main stations:

1.  **Measuring Station:**
    *   Uses an ESP32 and an ultrasonic sensor to continuously measure the water level.
    *   Transmits the data to the Control Station via LoRa wireless communication.

2.  **Control Station:**
    *   Uses an ESP32-S3 to receive data from the Measuring Station.
    *   Displays warning levels on an LCD and through status LEDs.
    *   Activates a loudspeaker to play a pre-recorded warning.
    *   Sends alert notifications to a configured Telegram channel.
